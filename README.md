**P.S. The test assignment is unfinished, I wrote it half a year ago, but to my surprise, based on the code, JWT authentication is done (i.e. User CRUD) and Article CRUD is also done. Surprisingly I even implemented sorting by rating and creation date. Also Docker-compose is written for raising PostgreSQL.**
